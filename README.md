# README FOR CHIROPRACTORS DIRECTORY

I'm pretty excited to be working on my first [chiropractor](http://renochiropractor.org) directory.  This directory will be a nationwide list of chiropractors.  If it takes off, it should be bigger than my last directory project.

Why is this important?  Well, if I can get a chiropractor program setup that ranks well and is seen as pertinent for healthcare, or medicine or holistic medicine, maybe I can make links that will help chiropractor practitioners to make it to the top of the search engines and make more income.  

So far, I have MONTHS of trying to get chiropractors to rank.  Not going well.  Even with good SEO practices and plenty of trust flow over citation flow, the chiropractic world is hard to make changes to.

Things I want to have in this program:

* Really fast response

* Friendly, pretty URLs

* Payment system to charge for the listings

* Database to market from

* Simple, fast UI using [BootStrap](http://getbootstrap.com)

* Easy, and clean UX

* ...

So, we'll see how it goes.  I am going to dedicate a lot of my spare time for this project and I hope that I can turn it into a revenue stream.
